# GitHub Actions Workflow Strategy

## Current Setup (RECOMMENDED ✅)

**Primary Workflow**: `deploy-to-hf-advanced.yml`
- **Triggers**: Push to main, Manual dispatch
- **Features**: Full validation, retry logic, comprehensive error handling

**Backup Workflow**: `deploy-to-hf.yml` 
- **Triggers**: Manual only (disabled automatic)
- **Purpose**: Fallback if advanced workflow fails

## Alternative Strategies

If you want both workflows active, here are some options:

### Strategy A: Different Triggers
- **Advanced**: Push to main (production)
- **Simple**: Push to develop branch (testing)

### Strategy B: Conditional Triggers
- **Advanced**: Default for all commits
- **Simple**: Only when commit message contains `[simple-deploy]`

### Strategy C: Different Purposes
- **Advanced**: Full deployment with validation
- **Simple**: Quick deploy for documentation changes only

## Current Recommendation

**Use only the advanced workflow** because:
- ✅ **No conflicts** - Only one workflow runs
- ✅ **Better reliability** - Comprehensive error handling  
- ✅ **More features** - Validation, retry logic, manual trigger
- ✅ **Cleaner logs** - No duplicate deployments

## If You Need Both

To re-enable the simple workflow with different triggers:

```yaml
# Simple workflow - for testing/development
on:
  push:
    branches: [ develop ]
  workflow_dispatch:

# Advanced workflow - for production  
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  workflow_dispatch:
```

## Emergency Recovery

If the advanced workflow fails, you can manually trigger the simple one:
1. Go to Actions tab
2. Select "Deploy to Hugging Face Spaces (Simple)"
3. Click "Run workflow" 
4. Enable the deployment option
