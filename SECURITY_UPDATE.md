# 🔐 Security Update: API Keys Setup

## ✅ What's Changed

I've updated your GitHub Actions workflows to follow security best practices:

- **✅ Removed API keys from GitHub Actions** - No more OPENAI_API_KEY or ANTHROPIC_API_KEY in GitHub secrets
- **✅ Kept only Hugging Face variables** - HF_TOKEN, HF_USERNAME, HF_SPACE_NAME remain in GitHub
- **✅ Updated all documentation** - Setup scripts and guides now reflect this change

## 🔧 Your Current GitHub Secrets (Keep These)

| Secret Name | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| `HF_TOKEN` | Hugging Face write token for deployment |
| `HF_USERNAME` | Your Hugging Face username |
| `HF_SPACE_NAME` | Your space name |

## 🎯 Next Steps

### 1. Remove API Keys from GitHub (if you added them)
If you previously added these to GitHub, you can remove them:
- Go to your repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
- Delete: `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (if they exist)

### 2. Add API Keys to Hugging Face Space
Follow the guide in `HF_SPACE_SETUP.md`:
1. Go to your deployed space settings
2. Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` as space secrets
3. Restart your space

## 🔒 Why This Is Better

- **🛡️ Better Security**: API keys are only stored where they're used
- **🎯 Separation of Concerns**: GitHub handles deployment, HF handles runtime
- **🔄 Easier Management**: Change API keys without touching GitHub
- **📊 Better Monitoring**: HF Space logs show API usage, not deployment logs

## 🚀 Deploy and Test

1. **Push your changes** to trigger deployment
2. **Check deployment logs** - should work without API keys
3. **Set HF Space secrets** - follow `HF_SPACE_SETUP.md`
4. **Test your app** - should work with API calls

Your workflows will now be more secure and easier to manage! 🎉
